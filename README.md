# Geographic Network Visualisation
*Sarah Sch√∂ttler*

This is the companion website for my dissertation for my MSc in Design Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. For my dissertation, I have developed a taxonomy and collected and classified techniques to visualise geographic networks. The collected techniques and their classification are shown on this website.
