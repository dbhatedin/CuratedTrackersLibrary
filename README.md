# Geographic Network Visualization Techniques: A Work-In-Progress Taxonomy
*Sarah Sch√∂ttler, Tobias Kauer, Benjamin Bach*

In my MSc dissertation, I developed a taxonomy for geographic network visualization techniques based on a survey of 60 techniques. We are now presenting this work as a poster at Graph Drawing 2019 with the aim to develop it further. The taxonomy categorizes each technique across four facets: 
* how the geographic aspect is represented
* how the network aspect is represented
* how these two visual representations are integrated
* whether the technique relies on user interaction
