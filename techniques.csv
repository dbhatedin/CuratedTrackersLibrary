The technology is rapidly improving and may, in the long term, replace traditional flat panel displays in many situations. When displays are no longer intrinsically flat, how should we use the space around the user for abstract data visualisation? In this paper, we ask this question with respect to origin-destination flow data in a global geographic context. We report on the findings of three studies exploring different spatial encodings for flow maps. The first experiment focuses on different 2D and 3D encodings for flows on flat maps. We find that participants are significantly more accurate with raised flow paths whose height is proportional to flow distance but fastest with traditional straight line 2D flows. In our second and third experiment we compared flat maps, 3D globes and a novel interactive design we callMapsLink, involving a pair of linked flat maps. We find that participants took significantly more time with MapsLink than other flow maps while the 3D globe with raised flows was the fastest, most accurate, and most preferred method. Our work suggests thatcarefuluse of the third spatial dimension can resolve visual clutter in complex flow maps.",2019-01,21/05/2019 14:15,10/06/2019 11:56,,693-703,,1,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,D:\Data\Documents\Design Informatics\Zotero\storage\K66YZ8BD\Yang et al. - 2019 - Origin-Destination Flow Maps in Immersive Environm.pdf,,data visualisation; Data visualization; Encoding; geographic information systems; Clutter; 3D globe; abstract data visualisation; Aerospace electronics; augmented reality; augmented-reality headsets; Cartographic Information Visualisation; encoding; flat image; flat panel displays; Flow Map; flow paths; global geographic context; image processing; Immersive Analytics; immersive environments; interactive design; linked flat maps; MapsLink; Origin-destination; origin-destination flow maps; spatial encodings; straight line 2D flows; Three-dimensional displays; Two dimensional displays; Virtual reality; Virtual Reality; virtual-reality headsets; visual clutter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yang2019,evaluation,map,low-low,base-geo,required-interaction,flow map in VR,2,1,1,0,2,0,2,1,0,0

A large number of techniques have been proposed to reduce visual clutter of flow maps, such as filtering, clustering and edge bundling, but the correlations of OD flows are often neglected, which makes the simplified OD flow map present little semantic information. In this paper, a characterization of OD flows is established based on an analogy between OD flows and natural language processing (NPL) terms. Then, an iterative multi-objective sampling scheme is designed to select OD flows in a vectorized representation space. To enhance the readability of sampled OD flows, a set of meaningful visual encodings are designed to present the interactions of OD flows. We design and implement a visual exploration system that supports visual inspection and quantitative evaluation from a variety of perspectives.

For studying the spatio-temporal patterns and trends of mass mobility, individual OD moves of many people are aggregated into flows (collective moves) by time intervals. Time-variant flow data pose two difficult challenges for visualization and analysis. First, flows may connect arbitrary locations (not only neighbors), thus making a graph with numerous edge intersections, which is hard to visualize in a comprehensible way. Even a single spatial situation consisting of flows in one time step is hard to explore. The second challenge is the need to analyze long time series consisting of numerous spatial situations. We present an approach facilitating exploration of long-term flow data by means of spatial and temporal abstraction. It involves a special way of data aggregation, which allows representing spatial situations by diagram maps instead of flow maps, thus reducing the intersections and occlusions pertaining to flow maps. The aggregated data are used for clustering of time intervals by similarity of the spatial situations.

In this paper, we present a large-graph visualization system called ModuleGraph. ModuleGraph is a scalable representation of graph structures by treating a graph as a set of modules. The main objectives are: (1) to detect graph patterns in the visualization of large-graph data, and (2) to emphasize the interconnecting structures to detect potential interactions between local modules. Our first contribution is a hybrid modularity measure. This measure partitions the cohesion of the graph at various levels of details. We aggregate clusters of nodes and edges into several modules to reduce the overlap between graph components on a 2D display. Our second contribution is a k-clustering method that can flexibly detect the local patterns or substructures in modules. Patterns of modules are preserved by the ModuleGraph system to avoid information loss, while sub-graphs are clustered as a single node. Our experiments show that this method can efficiently support large-scale social and spatial network visualization.Graphical AbstractGraphical Abstract text Open image in new window",01/05/2017,12/07/2019 12:04,12/07/2019 12:04,12/07/2019 12:04,205-215,,2,20,,J Vis,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,D:\Data\Documents\Design Informatics\Zotero\storage\DHVCPDP9\Li et al. - 2017 - Module-based visualization of large-scale graph ne.pdf,,,Information visualization; Network visualization; Graph drawing; Community detection; Module grouping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,li2017,technique,map,high-low,balanced,required-interaction,clustered node-link,0,2,0,0,2,0,2,1,0,0

To avoid visual clutter, we simplify our flow maps based on a force-driven algorithm, accounting for restrictions with respect to application semantics. The goal is to preserve important characteristics of the geospatial context.

The flow map is computed on the basis of flows between zones. We describe a method for auto-deriving zones from geospatial data according to application requirements.

W.; Speckmann, B.",Clustered edge routing,2015 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis),,,10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2015.7156356,,"The classic method to depict graphs is a node-link diagram where vertices (nodes) are associated with each object and edges (links) connect related objects. However, node-link diagrams quickly appear cluttered and unclear, even for moderately sized graphs. If the positions of the nodes are fixed then suitable link routing is the only option to reduce clutter. We present a novel link clustering and routing algorithm which respects (and if desired refines) user-defined clusters on links. If no clusters are defined a priori we cluster based on geometric criteria, that is, based on a well-separated pair decomposition (WSPD).We route link clusters individually on a sparse visibility spanner. To completely avoid ambiguity we draw each individual link and ensure that clustered links follow the same path in the routing graph.

This approach involves a new method for origin-destination flow density estimation and a new method for flow map generalization, which together can remove spurious data variance, normalize flows with control population, and detect high-level patterns that are not discernable with existing approaches. The approach achieves three main objectives in addressing the challenges for analyzing and mapping massive flow data. First, it removes the effect of size differences among spatial units via kernel-based density estimation, which produces a measurement of flow volume between each pair of origin and destination. Second, it extracts major flow patterns in massive flow data through a new flow sampling method, which filters out duplicate information in the smoothed flows. Third, it enables effective flow mapping and allows intuitive perception of flow patterns among origins and destinations without bundling or altering flow paths. The approach can work with both point-based flow data (such as taxi trips with GPS locations) and area-based flow data (such as county-to-county migration). Moreover, the approach can be used to detect and compare flow patterns at different scales or in relatively sparse flow datasets, such as migration for each age group.

In addition, classic network drawing algorithms (e.g. Fruchterman�Reingold) are not optimised for the representation of geographically fixed nodes, and the standard repertoire of cartography is not suited to mapping complex network information. To tackle these issues, a method-mediating circular layout is presented that (1) roughly preserves the geographical information, (2) allows for the drawing of less cluttered relations between the geographical entities, and (3) offers the possibility of including more information on the underlying node and edge attributes when compared to conventional two-dimensional layouts.

In particular, it is used for visualization of geographic networks where vertices have fixed coordinates. Two main drawbacks of the common approach of bundling the interior of edges are that (i) tangents at endpoints deviate from the line connecting the two endpoints in an uncontrolled way and (ii) there is ambiguity as to which pairs of vertices are actually connected. Both severely reduce the interpretability of geographic network visualizations.We therefore propose methods that bundle edges at their ends rather than their interior. This way, tangents at vertices point in the general direction of all neighbors of edges in the bundle, and ambiguity is avoided altogether.

Some of the known algorithms do not support edge-bundling and those that do, cannot guarantee crossing-free flows. We present a new algorithmic method that uses edge-bundling and computes crossing-free flows of high visual quality. Our method is based on so-called spiral trees, a novel type of Steiner tree which uses logarithmic spirals. Spiral trees naturally induce a clustering on the targets and smoothly bundle lines.

Many techniques for the exploration of spatio-temporal data have been developed, but they prove to be only of limited use when applied to temporal origin-destination datasets.

As dynamic networks exhibit different characteristics, e.g., being of sparse or dense structure, or having a continuous or discrete time line, a variety of visualization techniques have been specifically designed to handle these different aspects of network structure and time. This wide range of existing techniques is well justified, as rarely a single visualization is suitable to cover the entire visual analysis. Instead, visual representations are often switched in the course of the exploration of dynamic graphs as the focus of analysis shifts between the temporal and the structural aspects of the data. To support such a switching in a seamless and intuitive manner, we introduce the concept of in situ visualization- a novel strategy that tightly integrates existing visualization techniques for dynamic networks. It does so by allowing the user to interactively select in a base visualization a region for which a different visualization technique is then applied and embedded in the selection made. This permits to change the way a locally selected group of data items, such as nodes or time points, are shown - right in the place where they are positioned, thus supporting the user's overall mental map. Using this approach, a user can switch seamlessly between different visual representations to adapt a region of a base visualization to the specifics of the data within it or to the current analysis focus. This paper presents and discusses the in situ visualization strategy and its implications for dynamic graph visualization. Furthermore, it illustrates its usefulness by employing it for the visual exploration of dynamic networks from two different fields: model versioning and wireless mesh networks.",2011-12,08/06/2019 15:33,08/06/2019 15:33,,2334-2343,,12,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,D:\Data\Documents\Design Informatics\Zotero\storage\TBAHJ2HN\Hadlak et al. - 2011 - In Situ Exploration of Large Dynamic Networks.pdf,,,data visualisation; Data visualization; graph theory; Graphics; network theory (graphs); visual analysis; social networks; visual representations; bot nets; Dynamic graph data; dynamic graph visualization; in situ exploration; large dynamic networks; mental map; model versioning; multi-focus+context.; multiform visualization; network structure; visualization techniques; wireless mesh networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hadlak2011,technique,map,low-low,balanced,required-interaction,node-link enhanced with sub-diagrams,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2

Node-link diagrams, commonly used to visualize graphs, suffer from visual clutter on large graphs. Edge bundling is an effective technique for alleviating clutter and revealing high-level edge patterns. Previous methods for general graph layouts either require a control mesh to guide the bundling process, which can introduce high variation in curvature along the bundles, or all-to-all force and compatibility calculations, which is not scalable. We propose a multilevel agglomerative edge bundling method based on a principled approach of minimizing ink needed to represent edges, with additional constraints on the curvature of the resulting splines. The proposed method is much faster than previous ones, able to bundle hundreds of thousands of edges in seconds, and one million edges in a few minutes.",2011-03,########,########,,187-194,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,D:\Data\Documents\Design Informatics\Zotero\storage\GGZ3SD63\Gansner et al. - 2011 - Multilevel agglomerative edge bundling for visuali.pdf,,,data visualisation; Visualization; Image edge detection; Clutter; graph theory; Layout; graph drawing; clustering; node-link diagram; graph layout; Spline; Edge bundling; Ink; large graph visualization; multilevel; multilevel agglomerative edge bundling; Turning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2011 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,gansner2011,technique,map,low-low,base-geo,no-interaction,node-link edge bundling,0,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0

The stations on the route enjoy larger spaces, whereas the other stations are rendered smaller and closer to fit the whole map into a screen. To simplify the navigation and route planning for visitors, we formulate various map characteristics such as octilinear transportation lines and regular station distances into energy terms. We then solve for the optimal layout in a least squares sense. In addition, we label the names of stations that are on the route of a passenger according to human preferences, occlusions, and consistencies of label positions using the graph cuts method. Our system achieves real-time performance by being able to report instant information because of the carefully designed energy terms.

This can lead to loss of detail or the introduction of arbitrary artefacts in the visual representation. Here, we propose mapping OD vectors as cells rather than lines, comparable with the process of constructing OD matrices, but unlike the OD matrix, we preserve the spatial layout of all origin and destination locations by constructing a gridded two-level spatial treemap. The result is a set of spatially ordered small multiples upon which any arbitrary geographic data may be projected. Using a hash grid spatial data structure, we explore the characteristics of the technique through a software prototype that allows interactive query and visualisation of 105-106 simulated and recorded OD vectors.

Previous methods require the graph to contain a hierarchy for this, or they construct a control mesh to guide the edge bundling process, which often results in bundles that show considerable variation in curvature along the overall bundle direction. We present a new edge bundling method that uses a self-organizing approach to bundling in which edges are modeled as flexible springs that can attract each other. In contrast to previous methods, no hierarchy is used and no control mesh. The resulting bundled graphs show significant clutter reduction and clearly visible high-level edge patterns.

This article explores the idea of exploiting the connection information provided by the network to help navigate these large spaces. We visually augment two traditional navigation methods, and develop two special-purpose techniques. The first new technique, called ""Link Sliding"", provides guided panning when continuously dragging along a visible link. The second technique, called ""Bring & Go"", brings adjacent nodes nearby when pointing to a node. We compare the performance of these techniques in both an adjacency exploration task and a node revisiting task.

Such geographically embedded networks (graphs) are usually very large. For example, the county-to-county migration data in the U.S. has thousands of counties and about a million migration paths. Moreover, many variables are associated with each flow, such as the number of migrants for different age groups, income levels, and occupations. It is a challenging task to visualize such data and discover network structures, multivariate relations, and their geographic patterns simultaneously. This paper addresses these challenges by developing an integrated interactive visualization framework that consists three coupled components: (1) a spatially constrained graph partitioning method that can construct a hierarchy of geographical regions (communities), where there are more flows or connections within regions than across regions; (2) a multivariate clustering and visualization method to detect and present multivariate patterns in the aggregated region-to-region flows; and (3) a highly interactive flow mapping component to map both flow and multivariate patterns in the geographic space, at different hierarchical levels. The proposed approach can process relatively large data sets and effectively discover and visualize major flow structures and multivariate relations at the same time.

Applying common graph drawing algorithms on such networks can result in drawings that are not highly readable in the dense areas. Additionally, networks whose layouts are defined geographically often have dense areas that are located within small geographical regions relative to the size of the entire network. In cases where relationships within these dense areas are of interest, it is desirable to be able to distort the graph layout such that the denser areas are enlarged from their original sizes.In this paper, we propose a technique for enlarging dense areas of a given graph layout, and shrinking sparse areas. This technique is applied to geographical layouts of railway networks and force-directed layouts of non-geographical networks.

The problem is that graphs of these real world data sets have many interconnected nodes, ultimately leading to edge congestion: the density of edges is so great that they obscure nodes, individual edges, and even the visual information beneath the graph. To address this problem we developed an interactive technique called EdgeLens. An EdgeLens interactively curves graph edges away for a person's focus attention without changing the node positions. This opens up sufficient space to disambiguate node and edge relationships and to see underlying information while still preserving node layout. Initially two methods of creating this interaction were developed and compared in a user study. The results of this study were used in the selection of a basic approach and the subsequent development of the EdgeLens.

The real-world systems we have to deal with contain connections of thousands of trains. To visualize such a system from a given set of time tables a so-called train graph is used. It contains a vertex for each station met by any train, and one edge between every pair of vertices connected by some train running from one station to the other without halting in between.In visualizations of train graphs, positions of vertices are predetermined, since each station has a given geographical location. If all edges are represented by straight-lines, the result is visual clutter with many overlaps and small angles between pairs of lines. We here present a non-uniform approach using different representations for edges of distinct meaning in the exploration of the data. Only edges of certain type are represented by straight-lines, whereas so-called transitive edges are rendered using Bézier curves. The layout problem then consists of placing control points for these curves.

This research views both individual‐based daily activities and a pandemic spread as spatial interaction problems, where locations interact with each other via the visitors that they share or the virus that is transmitted from one place to another. The research proposes a general visual analytic approach to synthesize very large spatial interaction data and discover interesting (and unknown) patterns. The proposed approach involves a suite of visual and computational techniques, including (1) a new graph partitioning method to segment a very large interaction graph into a moderate number of spatially contiguous subgraphs (regions); (2) a reorderable matrix, with regions ‘optimally’ ordered on the diagonal, to effectively present a holistic view of major spatial interaction patterns; and (3) a modified flow map, interactively linked to the reorderable matrix, to enable pattern interpretation in a geographical context. The implemented system is able to visualize both people's daily movements and a disease spread over space in a similar way. The discovered spatial interaction patterns provide valuable insight for designing effective pandemic mitigation strategies and supporting decision‐making in time‐critical situations.",########,########,########,########,859-877,,8,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,,,D:\Data\Documents\Design Informatics\Zotero\storage\RBIFHCFB\Guo - 2007 - Visual analytics of spatial interaction patterns f.pdf,,,Visual analytics; Decision support; Graph partitioning; Pandemic; Spatial data mining; Spatial interaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,guo2007,application,map,low-high,balanced,required-interaction,,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,2,0,0
QS5J5F5K,thesis,2016,"Zou, Lingbo",A Dynamic Approach for Visualizing Local and Global Information in Geo-spatial Network Visualizations,,,,,https://DalSpace.library.dal.ca//handle/10222/71580,"Geo-spatial network visualization is a fusion of visualization techniques and geographic information science, and has progressed rapidly in recent years. However, challenges still remain regarding the clarity of high density node-link graphs. We present a dynamic approach for revealing the underlying information in locally cluttered areas while maintaining global edge trends around them, by creating and positioning multiple radial layouts within a geo-spatial connected graph. Moreover, two time series data-flow visualization approaches at both local and global scales are proposed respectively, namely: the peapod model and the hub model. The peapod model focuses on data flows within the local area while the hub model addresses the relations between groups of nodes across the graph. The approach is further refined by leveraging integrated circular layouts, stacked graphs, and word cloud techniques in several complementary views to support the exploration of categorical and aggregated data. In addition to adhering to emergent design standards for geo-spatial visualization, the computational complexity and quantitative performance analysis on three different datasets were subsequently conducted to examine the scalability of the visualization model. The simulation results show that the main algorithms in our approach are able to achieve acceptable performance in real world test cases. Finally, our model's effectiveness are demonstrated by two significant case studies in different application fields, namely: US aero traffic network and GitHub collaboration graph. The case studies show that insightful knowledge can be discovered by the utilization of the dynamic approach and the support of various complementary features.",########,########,########,########,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,Thesis,,,dalspace.library.dal.ca,,,,D:\Data\Documents\Design Informatics\Zotero\storage\IITT3FWH\Zou - 2016 - A Dynamic Approach for Visualizing Local and Globa.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,zou2016,technique,map,low-low,base-geo,interaction-technique,,1,2,0,0,2,0,2,1,0,0

For large graphs, excessive edge crossings make the display visually cluttered and thus difficult to explore. In this paper, we propose a novel geometry-based edge-clustering framework that can group edges into bundles to reduce the overall edge crossings. Our method uses a control mesh to guide the edge-clustering process; edge bundles can be formed by forcing all edges to pass through some control points on the mesh. The control mesh can be generated at different levels of detail either manually or automatically based on underlying graph patterns. Users can further interact with the edge-clustering results through several advanced visualization techniques such as color and opacity enhancement. Compared with other edge-clustering methods, our approach is intuitive, flexible, and efficient.
